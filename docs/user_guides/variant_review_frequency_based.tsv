# VARIANT REVIEW TEMPLATE - FREQUENCY-BASED FILTERING
# Use this template when NOT using BAM co-occurrence analysis
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Export filtered VCF to fill columns 1-7
# 2. Add genomic context information (column 8)
# 3. Make decisions using frequency-based rules (columns 9-10)
# 4. Document rationale and biological context (columns 11-12)
# 5. Add reviewer info (columns 13-14)
#
# DECISION RULES (without read-level evidence):
#
# HIGH-FREQUENCY (≥50%):
#   Freq ≥80%, Quality ≥1000 → KEEP (dominant variant)
#   Freq 50-80%, Quality ≥1000 → KEEP (major variant)
#   Freq 50-80%, Quality <1000 → CHECK genomic context
#
# MID-FREQUENCY (20-50%):
#   Multiple nearby mid-freq → KEEP (possible mixed population)
#   Known variable region + high quality → KEEP
#   Isolated + high quality (>1500) → KEEP (mark uncertain)
#   Isolated + low quality → REMOVE (artifact)
#   Homopolymer region → REMOVE (indel artifact)
#
# LOW-FREQUENCY (5-20%):
#   Freq 10-20%, Depth ≥500X, Quality ≥2000 → KEEP
#   Freq 10-20%, Depth 200-500X, Quality ≥1500 → CHECK context
#   Freq 10-20%, Depth <200X → REMOVE (insufficient evidence)
#   Freq 5-10%, Depth ≥500X, Quality ≥2000 → UNCERTAIN (report with caveats)
#   Freq 5-10%, Depth <500X → REMOVE
#   Freq <5% → REMOVE (below detection threshold)
#
# BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT MODIFIERS:
#   Known hotspot/variable region → More lenient (KEEP borderline)
#   Conserved essential region → More stringent (REMOVE borderline)
#   Premature stop in essential gene → REMOVE (likely artifact, would be lethal)
#   Consistent with passage history → KEEP
#
# CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
#   HIGH: Frequency ≥50%, Quality ≥1500, Clear biological context
#   MEDIUM: Frequency 20-50%, Quality ≥1000, OR borderline with biological support
#   LOW: Frequency 5-20%, Quality <2000, OR uncertain context
#   UNCERTAIN: Report but note insufficient evidence without BAM validation
#
# GENOMIC CONTEXT FLAGS:
#   - "Homopolymer" = AAAA, TTTT runs (likely artifact)
#   - "Low-complexity" = Simple repeats (likely artifact)
#   - "Variable region" = Known from literature (biologically expected)
#   - "Conserved" = Essential/invariant region (unlikely real)
#   - "Near other variants" = Clustered mutations (possible haplotype)

# WHEN TO ESCALATE TO BAM CO-OCCURRENCE ANALYSIS:
# 1. Multiple mid-frequency variants (20-50%) - need to know if they're linked
# 2. Borderline low-frequency variants (10-15%) - need validation
# 3. Novel findings for publication - need read-level evidence
# 4. Contradictory biological expectations - need to resolve
# 5. Co-infection suspected - need to distinguish haplotypes
#
# CONSERVATIVE APPROACH (recommended without BAM):
# - Remove all variants <20% frequency
# - Remove mid-frequency (20-50%) unless multiple clustered OR known biology
# - Keep only high-frequency (≥50%) with quality ≥1000
# - Report uncertainties clearly in publication
#
# PUBLICATION NOTES:
# When using frequency-based filtering only, include in Methods:
# "Variants were filtered based on quality score (≥X), coverage depth (≥Y), and
#  frequency (≥Z%). Manual review excluded variants in low-complexity regions
#  and those with biological implausibility. Conservative frequency thresholds
#  were applied to minimize false positives in the absence of read-level
#  linkage validation."
