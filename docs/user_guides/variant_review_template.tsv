# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
# 1. Export your filtered VCF variants to fill in columns 1-7
# 2. Run check_read_cooccurrence.py to get co-occurrence data
# 3. Fill in columns 8-11 based on co-occurrence results
# 4. Make decisions using the guidelines below and fill in columns 12-14
# 5. Add biological context and reviewer info in columns 15-17
#
# DECISION GUIDELINES:
# - KEEP: Strong evidence variant is real (co-occurrence >95% with cluster, or emerging variant >80% linked)
# - REMOVE: Likely artifact (isolated singleton, homopolymer region, alignment issues)
# - FLAG: Requires manual inspection (suspicious pattern, mid-frequency orphan)
# - UNCERTAIN: Report but note low confidence (edge case, borderline evidence)
#
# CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
# - HIGH: Read-level evidence >95% co-occurrence, >1000 reads
# - MEDIUM: Co-occurrence 80-95%, or >500 reads
# - LOW: Co-occurrence <80%, or <500 reads
# - NONE: No co-occurrence data (variants >500bp apart)

#
# COMMON PATTERNS TO RECOGNIZE:
#
# 1. Major Haplotype Cluster:
#    - Multiple high-freq variants (>80%)
#    - Co-occurrence >95% between all pairs
#    - Decision: KEEP ALL
#    - Confidence: HIGH
#
# 2. Distinct Haplotypes (Co-infection or Mixed Population):
#    - Two sets of mid-freq variants (30-70%)
#    - High co-occurrence WITHIN each set
#    - Low co-occurrence BETWEEN sets (<5%)
#    - Decision: KEEP ALL (mark as different haplotypes)
#    - Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH
#
# 3. Emerging Variant:
#    - Low-freq variant (5-20%)
#    - High co-occurrence (>80%) with major haplotype
#    - Decision: KEEP
#    - Confidence: MEDIUM
#    - Note: Potential adaptation/selection
#
# 4. Artifact Indicators:
#    - Mid-freq (30-70%) but no linkage
#    - Located in homopolymer or low-complexity region
#    - Low quality score (<1000)
#    - Decision: REMOVE or FLAG
#    - Confidence: LOW
#
# 5. No Co-occurrence Data:
#    - Variants >500bp from others
#    - Use frequency and quality thresholds
#    - Decision: Based on standard criteria
#    - Confidence: NONE (mark as frequency-based)
