# Session Notes: Pathway 3 Testing & Gap QC Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Focus:** Testing Pathway 3 with complete model, implementing report generation

---

## Session Overview

This session continued work from a previous long conversation focused on implementing and testing VICAST Pathway 3 (model-based homology annotation). The major discovery from the previous session was that the model virus (NC_038433.1) had a 1,965 bp gap containing an unannotated NS5A protein, which prevented successful annotation transfer.

### Key Accomplishments

1. ✅ **Verified Pathway 3 now works with complete model**
   - Re-ran BLASTx with updated NC_038433.1 (including NS5A)
   - **Result: Found 10 proteins** (up from 5 with incomplete model)
   - Successfully transferred: E1, E2, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, **NS5A**, NS5B

2. ✅ **Implemented Markdown + PDF report generation**
   - Added `generate_markdown_report()` to viral_gap_qc.py
   - Added `_markdown_to_pdf()` method for PDF generation
   - Reports saved as `<genome_id>_pathway2_qc_report.{md,pdf}`

3. ✅ **Established manual review workflow for step1.5**
   - Updated step1.5_qc_annotation.py to support manual review
   - Added `--force` flag for proceeding despite gaps
   - Added `--no-reports` flag for stdout-only mode
   - Clear documentation of 3 integration modes

4. ✅ **Updated environment files for PDF generation**
   - Added `python-markdown` and `weasyprint` dependencies
   - Updated both environment_vicast_annotate.yml and environment.yml

## Problem Solved: Pathway 3 Annotation Transfer

### Background
In the previous session, we discovered that Pathway 3 only found 5/9 expected proteins when transferring annotations from NC_038433.1 (model) to NC_027998.1 (subject). The root cause was a 1,965 bp gap (positions 6423-8387) in the model virus annotation containing an unannotated NS5A protein.

### Solution Implemented
1. Used EMBOSS `getorf` to find ORFs in gap region (found 8 ORFs)
2. BLAST confirmed ORF #3 matched NS5A (27% identity to Simian pegivirus)
3. User manually added NS5A to NC_038433.1_no_polyprotein.tsv
4. Rebuilt SnpEff database with complete annotation (now has 10 proteins)

### Results
**Before (incomplete model):**
```
Found 5 proteins: E1, NS2, NS3, NS4B, NS5B
Missing: E2, NS4A, C_trunc, hypothetical, NS5A
```

**After (complete model with NS5A):**
```
Found 10 proteins: C_trunc, E1, E2, hypothetical, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B
Gap detection workflow successfully identified and fixed the issue!
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Markdown Report Generation

Added `generate_markdown_report()` method to `ViralAnnotationGapDetector` class in `viral_gap_qc.py`:

**Features:**
- Professional Markdown formatting with tables
- Severity breakdown with counts
- Detailed gap analysis for each gap
- Clear recommendations based on severity
- Methods section documenting gap detection thresholds
- Timestamped reports for documentation

**Example output structure:**
```markdown
# Pathway 2 QC Report: NC_038433.1

## ❌ Result: FAILED
**Large gaps detected** - Cannot use as model...

## Summary
Found **1 gap(s)** in annotation:

| Severity | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| CRITICAL | 1 | Extremely large gaps... |

### Gap #1: NS4B → NS5B
- **Position:** 6,423 - 8,387
- **Size:** 1,965 bp
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Definitely missing proteins

**Repair Attempts:**
- **GETORF:** 8 ORFs found - review manually
- **BLAST:** BLAST to NCBI recommended...
```

### 2. PDF Report Generation

Added `_markdown_to_pdf()` method to `Pathway2QC` class:

**Features:**
- Converts Markdown → HTML → PDF pipeline
- Professional CSS styling:
  - Clean typography (Helvetica/Arial)
  - Color-coded headings (blue theme)
  - Formatted tables with zebra striping
  - Proper spacing and margins
- Dependencies: `python-markdown` + `weasyprint`

**Usage:**
```python
qc = Pathway2QC()
is_approved, report = qc.validate_model_for_transfer(
    fasta_file,
    tsv_file,
    save_reports=True,  # Generate .md and .pdf
    genome_id="NC_038433.1"
)
```

### 3. Manual Review Workflow

Updated `step1.5_qc_annotation.py` to support manual review paradigm:

**Philosophy:**
- **NOT an automatic gate** - generates reports, user decides
- **Manual intervention required** for gap resolution
- **Flexible workflow** - can proceed with --force if needed

**New flags:**
```bash
--force         # Proceed despite gaps (manual decision)
--no-reports    # Skip MD/PDF generation (stdout only)
--auto-repair   # Attempt automatic ORF finding (experimental)
```

**Three integration modes:**

**Mode A: Manual Review (recommended)**
```bash
python step1.5_qc_annotation.py NC_038433.1
# Review reports, make decision
```

**Mode B: Automated Gate (strict)**
```bash
if ! python step1.5_qc_annotation.py $GENOME_ID; then
    echo "QC failed - review reports and fix"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Mode C: Warning Only (soft fail)**
```bash
python step1.5_qc_annotation.py $GENOME_ID || echo "WARNING: Review QC reports"
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Manual Review Instead of Automatic Gate?

**Rationale:**
1. **Gap interpretation requires domain knowledge** - A 100 bp gap might be:
   - A real missing protein (needs fixing)
   - 3' UTR (acceptable)
   - Intergenic spacer (acceptable)

2. **Not all gaps are equally problematic** - Minor gaps acceptable for models, critical gaps are not

3. **User knows their virus** - Researcher can make informed decisions based on:
   - Virus biology
   - Related virus annotations
   - Publication requirements

4. **Provides documentation trail** - Generated reports serve as:
   - QC documentation for methods sections
   - Record of decisions made
   - Audit trail for annotation quality

### Why Markdown + PDF?

**Markdown:**
- Human-readable plain text
- Version control friendly
- Easy to edit and annotate
- Works in any text editor

**PDF:**
- Professional appearance
- Ready for sharing with collaborators
- Suitable for supplementary materials
- Platform-independent rendering

## Files Modified

### New Methods Added

**viral_gap_qc.py:**
```python

   - User reviews reports and decides whether to fix gaps or proceed
   "
   ```

4. **Work on Pathways 3 and 4:**
   - Pathway 3: Further testing and parameter optimization
   - Pathway 4: De novo annotation pipeline (not yet implemented)

## Important Context for Future Sessions

### Polyprotein Coordinate Issue
When adding polyprotein genomes to SnpEff, each cleaved protein is listed as a separate CDS feature but:
- They share one continuous ORF (no individual start/stop codons)
- SnpEff will warn about START codon errors (80%) and STOP codon warnings (100%)
- This is **EXPECTED and ACCEPTABLE** for polyproteins
- Use `--no-validate` flag to bypass strict validation

### Model Virus Completeness is Critical
- **Cannot transfer proteins that don't exist in the model**
- Gap QC workflow (step1.5) catches this issue
- Always run step1.5 before using a virus as a Pathway 3 model
- Incomplete models result in incomplete annotation transfer

### Report Generation Dependencies
- PDF generation requires `python-markdown` and `weasyprint`
- Weasyprint has system dependencies (cairo, pango, etc.)
- May need troubleshooting on HPC systems
- Markdown-only output works without these dependencies

## Useful Commands

### Gap Detection & Repair
```bash
# Run QC with auto-repair attempt
python step1.5_qc_annotation.py NC_038433.1 --auto-repair

# Generate reports only (no auto-repair)
python step1.5_qc_annotation.py NC_038433.1

# Proceed despite gaps (manual decision)
python step1.5_qc_annotation.py NC_038433.1 --force

# Skip PDF/MD generation
python step1.5_qc_annotation.py NC_038433.1 --no-reports
```

### Manual Gap Repair
```bash
# Extract gap region
seqkit subseq -r 6423:8387 NC_038433.1.fasta > gap_region.fasta

# Find ORFs
getorf gap_region.fasta -minsize 225 -find 1 -outseq gap_orfs.fasta

# BLAST ORFs to identify proteins
blastp -query gap_orfs.fasta -db nr -remote -outfmt 6
```

### SnpEff Database Management
```bash
# Add virus to SnpEff (strict validation)
python step2_add_to_snpeff.py NC_038433.1 NC_038433.1_no_polyprotein.tsv

# Add polyprotein virus (skip validation)
python step2_add_to_snpeff.py NC_027998.1 NC_027998.1_blastx.tsv --no-validate

# Verify database
snpeff dump NC_038433.1 | head -20

# Check protein sequences
grep ">" /ref/sahlab/software/snpEff/data/NC_038433.1/protein.fa
```
