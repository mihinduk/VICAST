# VICAST Testing Session Notes

## Date: 2025-10-20

## Testing Status Summary

### Completed Testing
- ✅ **Pathway 1**: Already in SnpEff - WORKING
- ✅ **Pathway 2**: Well-annotated genome (Dengue NC_001477) - **COMPLETE SUCCESS**
- ⚠️ **Pathway 3**: VADR-enhanced annotation - **NEEDS RE-EVALUATION**
- ❌ **Pathway 4**: BLASTx annotation - NOT YET TESTED

## Pathway 2 Success Details

Successfully tested complete workflow:
1. Automatic genome download from NCBI (NC_001477 - Dengue)
2. GenBank parsing with polyprotein skipping
3. TSV generation for manual curation
4. Proper GFF3 with mRNA → CDS hierarchy
5. CDS and protein FASTA generation with correct headers
6. SnpEff database build with validation
7. Database ready for variant annotation

**Location:** `/scratch/sahlab/kathie/vicast/test/pathway2_dengue`

**Key fixes implemented:**
- Automatic NCBI download integration
- Duplicate ID resolution using gene names
- mRNA feature generation for proper hierarchy
- CDS/protein FASTA with matching IDs
- Variable scope fixes

## Pathway 3 (VADR) Issues - CRITICAL DECISION NEEDED

### Problems Encountered:

1. **Memory Requirements:**
   - VADR requires >16GB RAM for cmalign step
   - Gets killed even with 16GB SLURM allocation
   - Too memory-intensive for login nodes
   - Would require dedicated compute jobs

2. **Environment Complexity:**
   - Requires separate conda environment (vicast-vadr)
   - BLAST version conflicts (2.13 vs 2.15+)
   - Complex installation with model files
   - Path configuration issues with VADR_DIR

3. **Conda Environment Creation:**
   - Gets killed on login node during `conda env create`
   - Requires SLURM job with substantial memory
   - Long solve times for dependency resolution

4. **Practical Limitations:**
   - Cannot run interactively on HTCF login nodes
   - Adds significant complexity to pipeline
   - May not be worth the overhead for typical use cases

### VADR Fallback Works Correctly
- Script correctly falls back to standard parsing when VADR fails
- TSV still generated for manual curation
- No data loss when VADR unavailable

## ✅ DECISION MADE: VADR Pathway Removed (2025-10-20)

### Final Decision: Remove VADR (Option B - IMPLEMENTED)

**Rationale:**
- Too memory-intensive for typical HPC usage (>16GB required)
- Adds significant complexity with separate conda environment
- Most viral genomes are adequately annotated in NCBI
- Standard parsing with manual curation TSV is sufficient
- Fallback mechanism already works correctly

**Benefits Realized:**
- ✅ Single conda environment (simpler for users)
- ✅ Faster installation and testing
- ✅ Clearer documentation
- ✅ More maintainable codebase
- ✅ No functionality lost (manual curation catches issues)

### NEW Pathway Structure (Implemented)

1. **Pathway 1**: Already in SnpEff → Use existing database
2. **Pathway 2**: Well-annotated (NCBI) → Standard pipeline ✅ TESTED
3. **Pathway 3**: BLASTx annotation → Homology-based annotation
4. **Pathway 4**: Segmented viruses → Multi-chromosome genomes

### Files Updated (All Complete)

**Code Changes:**
- ✅ `vicast-annotate/README.md` - Removed Pathway 3 VADR, renumbered
- ✅ `vicast-annotate/step0_check_snpeff.py` - Updated pathway detection logic
- ✅ `vicast-annotate/step1_parse_viral_genome.py` - Removed --use-vadr flag and all VADR code
- ✅ `README.md` - Removed VADR references, simplified environment setup

**Environment Changes:**
- ✅ Deleted `environment_vadr.yml`
- ✅ Deleted `setup/install_vadr.sh`
- ✅ Deleted `setup/create_vadr_env.slurm`

**Documentation Changes:**
- ✅ `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Completely rewritten for single environment
- ✅ `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Already clean, no changes needed
- ✅ Updated validation sections to remove `validate_vadr`

   - Evaluate cost/benefit of complexity

2. **If Removing VADR:**
   - Renumber pathways (4→3, segmented→4)
   - Remove VADR-related code and docs
   - Simplify to single conda environment
   - Update all documentation

3. **If Keeping VADR:**
   - Document memory requirements clearly
   - Provide SLURM submission script for VADR jobs
   - Set realistic expectations about when to use
   - Consider making it truly optional/advanced

4. **Complete Testing:**
   - Test Pathway 1 (check existing genome)
   - Test Pathway 3/4 (BLASTx) if keeping that pathway
   - Test segmented virus handling
   - Create comprehensive testing documentation

5. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update README with clear pathway descriptions
   - Document memory requirements
   - Provide example workflows
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## Current Git Status

**Repository:** https://github.com/mihinduk/VICAST

## Implementation Summary (2025-10-20)

### Changes Successfully Applied

All VADR references have been removed from VICAST, resulting in a streamlined 4-pathway system:

**Code Simplifications:**
- Removed ~100 lines of VADR-specific code from `step1_parse_viral_genome.py`
- Simplified pathway detection logic in `step0_check_snpeff.py`
- Updated all help text and documentation strings

**User-Facing Improvements:**
- Single conda environment (`vicast`) instead of two
- Simpler installation instructions
- Clearer pathway decision tree
- Reduced disk space requirements (~5-7 GB vs ~12 GB)

**Documentation Clarity:**
- Rewrote ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md for single environment
- Updated all README files with new pathway structure
- Removed confusing two-environment workflow

### Ready for Next Steps

With VADR removed, the codebase is now:
- ✅ Simpler and more maintainable
- ✅ Easier for users to understand and install
- ✅ Ready for Pathway 3 (BLASTx) implementation
- ✅ Ready for testing with real-world genomes

**Recommended next actions:**
1. ✅ Verify Pathway 3 (BLASTx) script exists and is properly updated
2. Test complete Pathway 2 workflow on HTCF
3. Test Pathway 3 (BLASTx) on HTCF with BLAST+ installed
4. Test Pathway 4 (segmented viruses) thoroughly
5. Create comprehensive testing documentation
6. Consider creating example workflows

### Pathway 3 (BLASTx) Status

**Script:** `vicast-annotate/step1_blastx_annotate.py`
- ✅ Script exists and is well-implemented
- ✅ Updated from "Pathway 4" to "Pathway 3"
- ✅ Help text displays correctly
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing works
- ⏳ Full functional testing requires:
  - BLAST+ installation (`conda install -c bioconda blast`)
  - Access to BLAST database (nr, refseq_protein, or viral database)
  - Should be tested on HTCF with proper environment

**Features implemented:**
- BLASTx execution against protein databases
- Tabular output parsing
- Overlapping hit merging (keeps best hits)
- Product/gene name extraction from BLAST titles
- TSV generation for manual curation
- Comprehensive error handling and timeouts

### Lessons Learned

**Design Principle Validated:** "Build SYSTEMATIC solutions, not specific fixes"
- Rather than patching VADR's memory issues, we evaluated the root need
- Removing VADR simplified the entire system without losing functionality
- Manual curation TSV provides the validation users actually need

**Complexity Budget:**
- Every optional feature has a cost in documentation, testing, and support
- VADR's cost outweighed its benefit for typical use cases
- Sometimes less is more

## Session 2: Testing in viral_genomics Environment (2025-10-21)

### Environment Setup Issues Discovered

1. **NumPy/Pandas Version Conflict**
   - Error: `pandas is incompatible with numpy < 1.22.4`
   - Had numpy 1.22.3, pandas needed >=1.22.4
   - Fix: `pip install --upgrade numpy` (upgraded to 2.0.2)
   - Note: `conda install numpy=1.22.4` didn't work (permissions issue)

2. **SnpEff Environment Variables Missing**
   - Variables not set by default (SNPEFF_JAR, SNPEFF_DATA)
   - Required for step2 to work
   - Added to ~/.bashrc for permanent setup
   - Documented in README and ENVIRONMENT_README

3. **CDS/Protein FASTA Directory Bug**
   - Bug: Script tried to write files before directory existed
   - Error: `No such file or directory: .../NC_038433.1/cds.fa`
   - Fix: Added `os.makedirs(genome_dir, exist_ok=True)` in step2
   - Committed fix: 6963ae2

### Pathway Testing Results

**Environment Used:** `viral_genomics` (existing environment)
**Test Genome:** NC_038433.1 (Culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus)

| Pathway | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **1. SnpEff Check** | ✅ **WORKING** | Tested with NC_045512 (SARS-CoV-2) |
| **2. Well-Annotated** | ✅ **WORKING** | Full end-to-end test with NC_038433.1 |
| **3. BLASTx** | ⏳ **READY** | Script exists, needs BLAST installed |

### Pathway 2 Detailed Test Results

**Step 0: Pathway Detection**
```bash
python3 vicast-annotate/step0_check_snpeff.py NC_045512
```
- ✅ Correctly identified NC_045512 in SnpEff (Pathway 1)
- ✅ Clear recommendation and next steps

**Step 1: Parse Genome**
```bash
python3 vicast-annotate/step1_parse_viral_genome.py NC_038433.1
```
- ✅ Auto-downloaded NC_038433.1.gb from NCBI
- ✅ Auto-downloaded NC_038433.1.fasta
- ✅ Parsed GenBank file
- ✅ Skipped polyproteins (if any)
- ✅ Generated NC_038433.1_no_polyprotein.gff3
- ✅ Generated NC_038433.1_no_polyprotein.tsv (editable)
- ✅ Found 9 CDS features

**Manual Curation Step**
- User reviewed and edited TSV file
- All features validated

**Step 2: Add to SnpEff**
```bash
python3 vicast-annotate/step2_add_to_snpeff.py NC_038433.1 NC_038433.1_no_polyprotein.tsv
```
- ✅ Generated CDS FASTA (9 sequences)
- ✅ Generated protein FASTA (9 sequences)
- ✅ Validated GFF3 (warnings about mRNA+CDS overlap are normal)
- ✅ Copied files to SnpEff data directory
- ✅ Built SnpEff database successfully
- ✅ Database ready for variant annotation

**Database Location:**
- `/ref/sahlab/software/snpEff/data/NC_038433.1/`
- Contains: sequences.fa, genes.gff, cds.fa, protein.fa, snpEffectPredictor.bin

### Code Fixes Applied

1. **Fix CDS/protein directory creation** (commit 6963ae2)
   - Added directory creation before writing FASTA files
   - Prevents "No such file or directory" errors

2. **Document SnpEff environment variables** (commit 6824eac)
   - Added to README.md and ENVIRONMENT_README.md
   - Included HTCF-specific paths
   - Showed how to add to ~/.bashrc

3. **Document HPC best practices** (commit 0fab9f6)
   - Warning about not installing on login nodes
   - Conda /tmp usage issues
   - Interactive session requirements

4. **Fix environment files** (commit 51641da)
   - Removed strict BLAST version (>=2.15.0 → blast)
   - Removed exact version pins
   - Created environment_minimal.yml

### Lessons Learned

1. **Existing environments work fine**
   - Don't need dedicated `vicast` environment
   - Any environment with Python, Biopython, Pandas works
   - Just need to upgrade numpy if version conflict

2. **Environment variables are critical**
   - Must document SNPEFF_JAR and SNPEFF_DATA prominently
   - Should be in ~/.bashrc for permanent setup
   - Scripts fail silently without them

3. **Directory creation is needed**
   - Can't assume directories exist
   - Use `os.makedirs(dir, exist_ok=True)` pattern

4. **HPC citizenship matters**
   - Login node /tmp issues affect everyone
   - Conda cache can fill disk quotas
   - Need clear warnings in documentation

### Ready for Production

VICAST is now production-ready for Pathways 1 and 2:
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Environment setup documented
- ✅ Bugs fixed
- ✅ Tested on real genome
- ✅ Works in existing environments
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed

### For Colleagues

Colleagues can now:
1. Use existing environment (if has Python, Biopython, Pandas)
2. Or create minimal environment: `conda env create -f environment_minimal.yml`
3. Set SnpEff variables in ~/.bashrc
4. Run VICAST annotation pipelines

**Recommended test:**
```bash
# Set up environment variables (one time)
echo 'export SNPEFF_JAR=/ref/sahlab/software/snpEff/snpEff.jar' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export SNPEFF_DATA=/ref/sahlab/software/snpEff/data' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Test with Dengue virus (well-annotated example)
mkdir -p ~/vicast_test && cd ~/vicast_test
python3 /path/to/VICAST/vicast-annotate/step1_parse_viral_genome.py NC_001477
# Review the TSV file
python3 /path/to/VICAST/vicast-annotate/step2_add_to_snpeff.py NC_001477 NC_001477_no_polyprotein.tsv
```

### Remaining Work

1. **Pathway 3 (BLASTx)** - Needs BLAST installation for testing
   - Script is complete and updated
   - Needs `conda install -c bioconda blast` in test environment
   - Or test with colleague who has BLAST installed

2. **Pathway 4 (Segmented)** - Needs testing with real data
   - Script exists (vicast_annotate_segmented.py)
   - Needs test with influenza or rotavirus segments

3. **Documentation** - Could add
   - Example workflows
   - Troubleshooting guide expansion
   - Video walkthrough (optional)
